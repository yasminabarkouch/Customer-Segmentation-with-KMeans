# Customer Segmentation with KMeans, Pipelines, and Elbow Method

This project applies KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score, using scikit-learn pipelines for preprocessing and clustering. The elbow method is implemented to determine the optimal number of clusters, and Bokeh is used to create interactive visualizations.

##  Dataset Source

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Bike Buyers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python?resource=download) 
- The dataset includes the following fields:
  - CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score

---

##  Key Steps

- **Data Selection**
  - Selected relevant numerical features (age, annual_income, spending_score).
- **Preprocessing**
  - Applied StandardScaler via a ColumnTransformer to standardize numerical data.
- **Pipeline Construction**
  - Combined preprocessing and KMeans clustering into a single scikit-learn Pipeline.
- **Optimal Cluster Search**
  - Used the elbow method to determine the best number of clusters based on inertia values.
 - **Model Fitting & Prediction**
  - Assigned customers to clusters and stored results in the original dataset.
- **Visualization**
  - Elbow curve showing inertia vs. k
